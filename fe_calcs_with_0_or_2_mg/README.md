# Free energy calculations with RNA model with zero or two Mg2+ ions

This directory contains equilibration and alchemical free energy calculations of theophylline and its analogs using BFEE2 Alchemical Route.


## Directory Map ##

Directories were organized using the following structure:  `[#-ligand]/[#-condition]/[#-protocol]/[#-replicate]/`.
eg. For example the first replicate of the simulations of theophylline with RNA aptamer with 55 mM NaCl condition and 2 structural Mg2+ ions with our default alchemical protocol can be found in this path: `2-theophylline/3-55NaCl_Mg/1-40winCmplx_30winLig/1-rep1/`.

We performed free energy calculations for all six ligands mentioned in the manuscript, however only directories of theopylline and xanthine are provided in this repository as examples (`2-theophylline/` and `6-xanthine/`). The setup of calculations of other analogs was exactly the same as the steps for xanthine. 

All free energy calculations were run as three independent replicates. Here, we provided the input files and scripts for only the first replicate (`1-rep1/`) to limit repository size. The other replicates were originally organized under separate directories in the same location (`2-rep2/` and `3-rep3/`).

For the "1-rna_only" system, only the equilibration was done to check if the RNA undergoes large conformational changes without the bound ligand or not.

## Protocols  ##

### A. Conda environments ###  
You can find the environment requirement files in: `../cond_envs`

### B. System set up ###
Necessary files for initial system preparation can be found in `1-sys_prep` directory for each system.

For conditions: {1-150KCl_Mg, 3-55NaCl_Mg, 6-55NaCl_Mg_bb, 7-55NaCl_Mg_postEq_bb} we include 2 Mg2+ ions binding to the RNA 
(for other conditions we don't have the "0-add_Mg.tcl" step but the other step are the same):

1) `0-add_Mg.tcl`: Places two Mg2+ on the RNA as described by [Gouda et al.](https://doi.org/10.1002/bip.10270)

    `vmd -dispdev text -e 0-add_Mg.tcl`

2) `1-extract_lig_pdb_resname.tcl`: Changes resname of all ligands to "SML" (user needs to set the ligand resname as found in the pdb first).
Also, writes out separate pdb files for RNA and ligand.

    `vmd -dispdev text -e 1-extract_lig_pdb_resname.tcl`

3) `2-run_system_setup.sh`: Prepares the pdb and prmtop file using Ambertools. User needs to set the ligand charge in this file.
This file also reads in the "tleap.in" to build the system.

    `bash 2-run_system_setup.sh`

4) `3-gen_psf.py`: Generates psf file from pbd and prmtop files. The psf is not used for simulation purposes, but might be useful for visualization using VMD.

    `python 3-gen_psf.py`

5) For the free energy calculations, the last snapshot from the 100 ns unrestrained simulation (equ_2) is first extracted and then RNA is moved to the center 
of the box and water and ions are wrapped around it using `wrap.tcl`. There is a bash script, `run_wrap.sh`, to run this script
for all systems and replicas, found in the main directory. After running `wrap.tcl`, `ini/` directory is created in `2-sim_run/`
and `eq.pdb` and `eq.psfare` generated in there. We use `eq.pdb` as input for generating free energy calculations using BFEE2.
User must open the `eq.pdb` in a visualization software such as PyMol and check the structure to avoid the ligand being stretched across the periodic boundary.

6) Next step is generating input files for the FEP calculations using BFEE2 GUI. After [installing BFEE2](https://github.com/fhh2626/BFEE2#installation), X11 forwarding is used to run `BFEE2Gui.py` on the AWS instance using: `ssh -X USERNAME@Instance IP Address`.

7) After generating the input file using BFEE2, user needs to run "run_fix_ligOnly.sh", to neutralize the ligandOnly system. 

### B.1. Adding backbone restraints ###
For conditions, 5-55NaCl_bb, 6-55NaCl_Mg_bb, and 7-55NaCl_Mg_postEq_bb we applied backbone restraints (2 kcal/mol/A**2)
For conditions: 5-55NaCl_bb, 6-55NaCl_Mg_bb user needs to first generate each systems and after equilibration and
generation of files w/ BFEE, the user needs to run `run_add_bb.sh` to add restraint-specific lines in the config files.

The condition 7-55NaCl_Mg_postEq_bb sets the restraints to the last frame of the "000_eq" equilibration, to compare
with the condition 3-55NaCl_Mg, where we don't have the restraints. Hence 7-55NaCl_Mg_postEq_bb starts the calculations
from after 10 ns equilibration in 3-55NaCl_Mg and only runs the steps 1 (001_MoleculeBound) and 2 (002_RestraintBound).
To set the restraints user needs to run: `run_add_bb_postEq.sh`.

### C. Running the simulations ###

All simulation files can be found in the `2-sim_run/` directory for each system.

Initially, each system is equilibrated in 3 steps: equ_0, equ_1, and equ_3. Before running these simulations, make sure the restraint file
is generated in the `restraints/` directory by running:

    `vmd -dispdev text -e restraints.tcl`

You can run the simulations in equ_0, equ_1, and equ_3, through the `run_1.sh` found in `2-sim_run/` directory.
The user can use "p3.2xlarge" instance for these equilibration steps.

Free energy calculations are set up using the BFEE2 tool:

For the default method of FEP and TI calculations, 40 and 30 windows are chosen (1-40winCmplx_30winLig), respectively for the complex and ligand-only systems.
In some cases we explored deviations to lambda protocol, such as doubling the lambda windows or sampling.
For all ligands and for only the condition: {1-150KCl_Mg}, we ran only the ligand-bound system with 80 windows (2-80winCmplx)

Free energy calculations can be submitted to "g5.4xlarge" instances for running with NAMD.

#### C.1. Testing parallel running of backward and forward calculation ####
To test the effects of running the forward transformation in parallel with the backward, with input from `000_eq/output/eq.restart.*`
instead of the backward's last frame, the user can run `run_bkw_frw_test.sh` to make the directories and change the config files.
This test has been done for "6-xanthine" and "7-caffeine" in two conditions: `4-55NaCl` and `5-55NaCl_bb`.
In these tests, only the calculations of the complex (ligand-bound) system is tested for both steps 1 and 2 (001_MoleculeBound and 002_RestraintBound).
We found that running backward and forward calculations in parallel did not significantly affect the results.

#### C.2. Benchmark ####
For complex (RNA-small molecule) system with 40 windows (1 ns/win):

    1. p3.2xlarge   1 GPU    3 CPUs      ~ 2 days, 15 hr
    2. g5.4xlarge   1 GPU    6 CPUs      ~ 1 day,  7  hr

`171             for j in range(len(backward_data[0])):`
